# How to solve the excercise

When you accept the request for contributing in the excercise repository, you have 3 hours to provide a solution according to de description in the README.md file.

At first create a branch from main with your name, the date and the time, and start working on the solution.

Think in atomic changes to show your way of working.

The commits in the first 3 hours are considered as your solution to be checked. (You can add commits later to improve your solution if you feel so).
